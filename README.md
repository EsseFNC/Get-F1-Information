# Get F1 Information

This project provides real-time F1 Information using API communications.

Special thanks to the [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org/) for making this little project possible
## Key Features
- **Drivers**:  information about drivers for each session.
- **Cars**: data about each car, at a sample rate of about 3.7 Hz.
- **Intervarls**:  real-time interval data between drivers and their gap to the race leader.
- **Sessions**: information about sessions.
- **Race Controls**: information about race control (racing incidents, flags, safety car, ...).

**NOTE**: *Sessions* and *Race Controls* used to work but at the moment they don't and i still don't know the actual reason.
